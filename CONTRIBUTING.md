# Contributing Guidelines

This repository is primarily maintained as a personal learning and portfolio project.
However, the following guidelines are followed to ensure consistency, clarity, and scalability.

---

## General Principles

- Focus on learning value over quantity.
- Prioritize clean, readable, and well-structured code.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Write solutions as if they were meant to be read by others.

---

## Repository Structure

- Challenges are organized by platform, language, and difficulty level.
- Data-oriented cases live under `projects/`.
- Templates are provided under `templates/` for consistency.

---

## Code Standards

### SQL
- Use clear formatting and indentation.
- Prefer explicit column names.

### Python
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Add brief comments when logic is not immediately obvious.

---

## Commits

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- One logical change per commit when possible.

Examples:
- `docs: improve README formatting`
- `feat: add SQL solution for challenge_name (platform_name)`
- `feat: add case project for exercise_type (data_name)`

---

## Documentation

- Each solution should be understandable without external context.
- When applicable, add brief explanations or comments.
